Our activity is simple: add your name to the file `names.txt`.

E.g. `names.txt` should look like this:

```
Fred Johnson
Bob Smith
Jennifer Jones
Mary Oliver
```

The trick is that every time someone else pushes up, you will have to pull down their commits first before you can push yours up. So basically, this is a sort of race. With git. ;)
